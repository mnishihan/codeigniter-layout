#Layout
##An advanced layout library for CodeIgniter.

Many CodeIgniter learners still find it difficult to apply templates to their projects. The layout library makes it simple for both new and experienced CodeIgniter coders to add nested templates to their application.

Templates are defined in a simple array format, and can be as simple or as complex as you like, built to suit your ever need.
